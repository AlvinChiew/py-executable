# Quick Start

1. create venv (wsl: use /usr/bin/python3)
1. install requirements.txt
1. run `auto-py-to-exe` in console
1. *install missing dependencies from error message, if any

# Remarks

1. while running exe on console, run with `./*.exe`. DO NOT run `python ./*.exe`
1. *.exe built in win10 can also be run in wsl2, somehow
